### 9. Tests  

* No unit tests have been written for this application.  

* There is a problem opening the application on a mobile phone, the header (banner) does not render correctly to the screen.

* There is a slight delay with the application storing the changes made in the editor so if you are too quick to close the application, sometimes the data does not persist.
